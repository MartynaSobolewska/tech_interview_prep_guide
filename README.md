Preparation checklist to help prepare in a more guided manner

## Topic checklist + table of contents
Handy if you want to see what content is available and what is coming. All content is divided by the topics and within them, 
difficulty level as shown on LeetCode. The order is not random. Concepts are helpful in further topics.
LeetCode questions are grouped by data structure or by algorithm.

## helpful concepts 
- [x] big O complexity analysis ☞ [how to O](concepts/bigO/README.md)

## Data structures
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Hash tables
- [x] Trees
  - implementation ☞ [see here](data_structs_and_algorithms/data_structs_implementations/tree/TreeNode.java)
  - description ☞ [see here](data_structs_and_algorithms/data_structs_implementations/tree/README.md)
- [x] Graphs
  - implementation ☞ [see here](data_structs_and_algorithms/data_structs_implementations/graph/Graph.java)
  - description ☞ [see here](data_structs_and_algorithms/data_structs_implementations/graph/README.md)
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Heaps

## Algorithms
- sorting algorithms:
  - [ ] Merge sort


- tree algorithms:
  - [x] Breadth-first search ☞ [see here](data_structs_and_algorithms/algorithm_focus/trees/breadth_first_search)
  - [ ] Depth-first search
  - [ ] Binary Search

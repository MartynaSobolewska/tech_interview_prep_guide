# CLASSES
## Destructor
For a C++ class, a destructor is a special method that handles object destruction, 
generally focused on preventing memory leaks. Class destructors donâ€™t take arguments as 
input and their names are always preceded by a tilde ~.
```c++
City::~City() {

  // Any final cleanup

}
```

## Class Members
A class is comprised of class members:
- Attributes, also known as member data, consist of information about an instance of the class.
- Methods, also known as member functions, are functions that can be used with an instance of the class.
```c++
class City {

  // Attribute
  int population;

public:
  // Method
  void add_resident() {
    population++;
  }

};
```

## Constructor
For a C++ class, a constructor is a special kind of method that enables control regarding how the objects of a 
class should be created. Different class constructors can be specified for the same class, but each constructor 
signature must be unique.
```c++
#include "city.hpp"

class City {

  std::string name;
  int population;

public:
  City(std::string new_name, int new_pop);

};
```

## Access Control Operators
C++ classes have access control operators that designate the scope of class members:
- public - members are accessible everywhere
- private - members can only be accessed from within the same instance of the class or from friends classes
```c++
class City {

  int population; 

public:
  void add_resident() { 
    population++;
  }

private:
  bool is_capital;

};
```
